The classification of cuisines is essential for helping customers find restaurants that match their dietary preferences and culinary interests. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze restaurant data, identify patterns, and accurately classify cuisines.\n","\n","The process will involve several key steps, including:\n","\n","1. **Data Preprocessing:** We will handle missing values and encode categorical variables to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.\n","2. **Data Splitting:** The dataset will be divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.\n","3. **Model Selection:** We will choose an appropriate classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forest, to train on the training data.\n","4. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the model will be assessed using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall on the testing data.\n","5. **Performance Analysis:** Finally, we will analyze the model's performance across different cuisines and identify any challenges or biases that may arise during classification.\n","\n","Through this task, we aim to build a robust classification model that can assist users in discovering restaurants based on their preferred cuisines.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wNwsw7IKeKKR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Step 1: Load the Dataset\n","\n","We begin by loading the restaurant dataset, which contains various features related to the restaurants, including their cuisines.\n","\n","```python\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","\n","# Load the dataset\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"/content/Dataset.csv\")\n","\n","# Display the first few rows of the dataframe\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"JUCFCNZfeQRQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns"],"metadata":{"id":"L_vNhJfV-Rz7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df=pd.read_csv(\"/content/Dataset.csv\")\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":811},"id":"X0kwkqOO-Uva","outputId":"4556c475-b107-464f-8f18-2ec495a8dac5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Restaurant ID         Restaurant Name  Country Code              City  \\\n","0        6317637        Le Petit Souffle           162       Makati City   \n","1        6304287        Izakaya Kikufuji           162       Makati City   \n","2        6300002  Heat - Edsa Shangri-La           162  Mandaluyong City   \n","3        6318506                    Ooma           162  Mandaluyong City   \n","4        6314302             Sambo Kojin           162  Mandaluyong City   \n","\n","                                             Address  \\\n","0  Third Floor, Century City Mall, Kalayaan Avenu...   \n","1  Little Tokyo, 2277 Chino Roces Avenue, Legaspi...   \n","2  Edsa Shangri-La, 1 Garden Way, Ortigas, Mandal...   \n","3  Third Floor, Mega Fashion Hall, SM Megamall, O...   \n","4  Third Floor, Mega Atrium, SM Megamall, Ortigas...   \n","\n","                                     Locality  \\\n","0   Century City Mall, Poblacion, Makati City   \n","1  Little Tokyo, Legaspi Village, Makati City   \n","2  Edsa Shangri-La, Ortigas, Mandaluyong City   \n","3      SM Megamall, Ortigas, Mandaluyong City   \n","4      SM Megamall, Ortigas, Mandaluyong City   \n","\n","                                    Locality Verbose   Longitude   Latitude  \\\n","0  Century City Mall, Poblacion, Makati City, Mak...  121.027535  14.565443   \n","1  Little Tokyo, Legaspi Village, Makati City, Ma...  121.014101  14.553708   \n","2  Edsa Shangri-La, Ortigas, Mandaluyong City, Ma...  121.056831  14.581404   \n","3  SM Megamall, Ortigas, Mandaluyong City, Mandal...  121.056475  14.585318   \n","4  SM Megamall, Ortigas, Mandaluyong City, Mandal...  121.057508  14.584450   \n","\n","                           Cuisines  ...

This will help us understand the distribution of cuisines and identify any that are rare.\n","\n","2. **Define Threshold**: A threshold will be set to determine what constitutes a \"rare\" cuisine. In our case, we have chosen a threshold of 3, meaning any cuisine that appears less than 3 times in the dataset will be considered rare.\n","\n","3. **Identify and Replace Rare Cuisines**: We will identify cuisines that fall below the threshold and replace them with a generic label, \"Other\". This allows us to reduce the dimensionality of our classification problem by consolidating infrequently occurring cuisines.\n","\n","4. **Assign Numeric Value**: To further simplify the encoding, we will replace the label \"Other\" with a numeric value, for instance, -1. This will help maintain a numeric format across the 'Cuisines' column.\n","\n","5. **Common Cuisines Handling**: Similarly, we will define a threshold for common cuisines. Any cuisine that occurs more frequently than this threshold (set to 50) will be labeled as \"Common\". We will replace this label with another numeric value, such as -2.\n","\n","After performing these operations, we will check the updated class distribution to ensure the changes have been made successfully.

This points to potential biases or class imbalances in the dataset, which may require further investigation and preprocessing to enhance model performance.\n","\n","Overall, the findings demonstrate that SVC and Logistic Regression are promising models for restaurant cuisine classification, but improvements in class balance and feature selection may lead to better classification outcomes in future iterations.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-V6YrGdDgNzs"}}]}
